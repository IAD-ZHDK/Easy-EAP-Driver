# Easy EAP driver
A driver and sequencer for prototyping with Dielectric Elastomers (Electroactive Polymers or EAP).

The device has both a push button activation control for EAP and an onboard sequencer for cyclic testing and creative purposes. For interactive work or for working in combination with other devices such as Arduino, the driver can be operated with a 5 volt signal from an external source. The device has an internal lipo battery with usb charging, and “hotswap” power management for uninterrupted usage during charging.

The Device Features:

* Internal Lipo Battery
* Rechargable over USB 
* Built in sequencer 
* Digital inputs for control with arduino 
* Push button control
* Indicator LEDS for battery charging
